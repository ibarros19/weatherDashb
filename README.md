  ## Description
  This is a weather-dashboard in which you can search for a weather current condition and also will receive a 5 days forecast. All your searches will be temporarily stored in the local storage. It does display the temperature, the date, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe.To make this application I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, Axios, bootstrap. and had to register and account at openweather to obtain the key for the API.
